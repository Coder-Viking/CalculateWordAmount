Implement Java application which loads the text file, calculates word statistic and exports the result to XML
Import and output file has to be defined like program parameter from command line.
Apply correct patterns typical for object-oriented programming (OOP) - decomposition and reusability.
Loading and exporting of files has to be done in buffered way - use BufferedReader or BufferedInputStream
Focus also on correct exception handling
Decide right place where to catch exception and apply correct behavior in case of exception
Define XML Schema for output XML format and use JAXB technology for generating of the export XML file
Use java classes generated via xjc tool

text file example

XML output example

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<statistics>
  <word>
    <value>Java</value>
    <count>3</value>
  </word>
  <word>
    <value>is</value>
    <count>1</count>
  </word>
</statistics>
